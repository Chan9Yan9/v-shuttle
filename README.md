## V-Shuttle: Scalable and Semantics-Aware Hypervisor Virtual Device Fuzzing



V-Shuttle is lightweight and semantics-aware fuzzer for type-2 hypervisors. It's built upon AFL. The fuzzer is based on our [paper](https://nesa.zju.edu.cn/download/pgn_pdf_V-SHUTTLE.pdf).

Here, we provide [V-Shuttle-M](https://github.com/hustdebug/v-shuttle/v-shuttle-m) (Main framework) and [V-Shuttle-S](https://github.com/hustdebug/v-shuttle/v-shuttle-s) (Enabling semantics-aware mode).
